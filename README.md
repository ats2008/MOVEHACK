__________________________________________________________

for feedback copy the feedback comments to the .csv file in the directory. (currently we have some comments on Ho-Ho buses and delhi metro rail in the file,so the result shown will be it analyzed on the taffic based general heads). 
Also , once the app is up and running the feedback from the apps database can directly be analyzed by the admin.The number of such comments we have is less so the analysis is much less accurate compared to what it can really do.

__________________________________________________________

for optimization the final result graphs are given in separate ziped folder. There can be a global decrease in the wait time for the passengers in delhi once the new time table is implemented . Also the ipython notebook  used to make it is also given as another zipped folder.other codes used for data extaction and processing are also submitted as additional_codes_zip
(requiered processed data too given)
